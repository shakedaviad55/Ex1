# Assignment Ex1:

 This project deals with a undirected weighted graph.
 this project is based on project Ex0 , link: https://github.com/shakedaviad55/Ex0.git.
 There are 2 main classes in the project, WGraph_DS which represents an undirected weighted graph,
 and algorithms class WGraph_Algo which impliments them using Dijkstra and BFS algorithms among others.
 


## initializetion of the project:
  git clone https://github.com/shakedaviad55/Ex1.git
  
## Working spaces:
- Eclipse IDE
- intelliJ IDE

## Tests:
Tests classes are included in the project, you can find in the Wiki's project
the visualization of the graphs which I use in the tester.

Hope you enjoyed the project, please share! :)
if there are any issues, please write me.
