# Assignment Ex1:

 This project deals with a undirected weighted graph.
 this project is based on project Ex0 , link: https://github.com/shakedaviad55/Ex0.git.
 There are 2 main classes in the project, WGraph_DS which represents an undirected weighted graph,
 and algorithms class WGraph_Algo which impliments them using Dijkstra and BFS algorithms among others.
 
 ## initializetion of the project:
  git clone https://github.com/shakedaviad55/Ex1.git
  
## Classes:

### WGraph_DS:
 in this class you can create graphs
- addNode - add nodes to the graph
- removeNode - remove node from the graph
- getV - returns all the nodes in the graph
- getV(node_id) - returns all the nodes in the graph be a unique key


### WGraph_Algo:
- init - initializes a specific graph
- copy - deep copy of a graph
- isConnected - checks if every single nodes are connected to each other
- shortestPathDist - returns the shortest path as weight between two vertices
- shortestPath - returns the shortest path between two vertices
- save - saves the graph to a file
- load - loads a file to a graph


  
## Working spaces:
- Eclipse IDE
- intelliJ IDE

## Tests:
Tests classes are included in the project, you can find in the Wiki's project
the visualization of the graphs which I use in the tester.


Hope you enjoyed the project, please share! :)
if there are any issues, please write me.
